We have a railway system which is made up of stations, they are all connected by tracks but only one track can exist between two stations. Trains go through these tracks to get to the station, all trains have passengers on them, the passengers get the train tickets by booking them.
All trains and all stations have their own workers, and all the workers follow a specific work schedule.
